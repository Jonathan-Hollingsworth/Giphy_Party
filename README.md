# Giphy_Party
These files use the Giphy API to do the following
## Search for a gif
You can search for a gif via keyword and JS will make a request and search through one of the first 50 responses and add it to the page
## Delete all gifs
Upon clicking the 'delete gifs' button all gifs will be deleted and you can begin searching again (doesn't use API)

##
The search and delete buttons have been stylized through jQuery  
You will need to establish a server yourself to fully utilize this
